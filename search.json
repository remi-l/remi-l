    "text": "The Cost-Efficiency of Supporting Homeownership According to Policy Objectives: French evidence\nwith Jean-Sauveur Ay and Julie Le Gallo (submitted)\n\n\nAbstract\n\nThis article develops a welfare analysis of subsidized loans for the access to homeownership, both in terms of number of additional homeowners (extensive margin) and change in the value of housings (intensive margin). We leverage pre-treatment variables and the precise location of homeowners to ensure a selection-on-observables identification strategy. We estimate doubly robust causal effects both on the policy recipients and the whole population of homeowners. Spatial and temporal variations of implementation details and credit market conditions allow us to relate these policy-relevant treatment effects to the budget costs of the French interest-free loan policy. We cannot reject that the policy has no causal effect on the extensive margin, whereas it significantly impacts the intensive margin. For different values of externalities (e.g. better housing maintenance, price capitalisation or reduced mobility) for both margins, we find that increasing policy intensity through more public spending negatively affects its cost-efficiency. This is true independently from credit market conditions that do not directly impact policy efficiency.\n\n\nApports des Fichiers Fonciers enrichis pour analyser les patrimoines fonciers-immobiliers des individus\nwith Laure Casanova-Enault, Antoine Peris and Martin Bocquet (submitted)"

Using administrative microdata on housing ownership and transactions in France over the period 2011-2019, we impute a market value for all housing portfolios held by private homeowners. We document strong housing wealth persistence (HWP) for this population, particularly with respect to the location of the main residences. We then examine HWP for three sub-populations identified from the panel structure of our data. HWP appears to be mainly driven by homeowners who change their main residence or receive a housing inheritance, while it is less pronounced for homeowners with a constant housing portfolio. The spatial sorting operated by the location choices of main residences (both between and within commuting zones) appears to be a key determinant of HWP, rather than capital gains from price variations of given housing portfolios.\n\n\nPrice Capitalization of Demand-side Policies with Segmented Housing Markets\n\n\nAbstract\n\nI consider the segmentation of the housing market locally by tenure status and type of construction assumed by policy makers. The segmentation assumption is inherently associated to the nature of the price capitalisation (i.e. whether it concerns the whole local housing markets or specific segments) that derive from demand-side policies in inelastic supply context. Moreover, I seek for potential underlying drivers for the price capitalisation based on investors’ residence place. I use policy reforms that solely affect demand for rental purchase in new housing to implement difference-in-difference strategy. The results support the assumption that local housing markets are segmented according to tenure status. Owner-occupier segments remain unaffected by the demand shock for rental investment. The price capitalisation is considerable within the subsidised segment (-13.5% for the policy repeal), accounting for more than half of the subsidy. I provide evidence that distant investors contribute to the price capitalisation. Finally, the rental investment scheme excludes potential buyers from the subsidised segment who switch to the unsubsidised segments (existing housing), which also indirectly leads to price capitalisation (+6.4% for positive demand shock)."
